    Hi, my name is Harry! I am currently a Product Data Engineer II at Expedia Group after being being promoted twice from a Data Analyst and Senior Business Intelligence Analyst, continuing to explore the boundless potential of big data and analytics. Throughout my career, I have experienced being a part of the full data life cycle, performing ETL on raw data and applying business logic for production-ready views using SQL, creating automated reports and dashboards with human-centered design using Python and Tableau, and presenting actionable data and statistics-driven insights to C-suite leaders.
  <br><br>
    I hold a Bachelor's in Pre-Medicine and a minor in Physics from Michigan State University. I taught myself computer science and python in my free time after being inspired by open source programs that regular people like me created to increase productivity in their life. After building simple productivity applications in python, I became fascinated with AI/ML and natural language processing (NLP). This passion and desire to solve business problems to boost productivity and efficiency through data drives me to continue learning and growing in and out of my work to make changes for good.
    <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Harry Lee
