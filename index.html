      Hi, my name is Harold, but you can call me Harry! I’m a Data Scientist II at Expedia Group, solving unique business problems by blending diverse datasets to create cohesive stories that make an impact for our most important customers – our people. During my tenure at Expedia Group, I have incorporated confidential people demographic and performance data with employee sales data and worked with the sales team to test their variable incentive plan proposal to identify potential biases and answer if the new plan pays for performance better than the previous. I have also optimized our flagship People Product Team’s dashboards, increasing load and filtering speeds in Tableau by 75%, and developed automated reporting solutions that deliver actionable insights to C-suite leadership.
      <br><br>
      Data Science is not only a career of mine, but also a passion. I love to learn about new concepts and algorithms in data science in my own free time. These projects encompass stacking algorithms, natural language processing, and generative AI, tackling areas like model performance in housing price prediction and deploying Langchain agents for accurate web searches and responses based on user prompts.
      <br><br>
      My most prominent skills are with SQL, Python, hypothesis testing, NLP, and data storytelling.
      <br><br>  - Harry Lee
