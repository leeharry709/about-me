      Hi, my name is Harold, but you can call me Harry! I’m a Data Scientist II at Expedia Group, solving unique business problems by blending diverse datasets to create cohesive stories that drive data-driven strategic decision making. During my tenure at Expedia Group, I have been promoted twice and experienced the full data lifecycle. I worked on ETL with raw data from our source systems and incorporated complex business logic and calculations on top of raw data to create production-ready tables. I have used those tables to generate automated insights to C-suite leadership regarding in-office attendance and our hybrid work policy every month, transform the tables further to power 100% of my team’s Tableau Suite as well as increasing filtering and load speeds by 75%, and explore research questions that directly affect our employees such as identifying key performance factors within personal identifiable demographic data and identifying potential demographic and performance biases in a proposed sales incentive plan.
      <br><br>
      My ultimate passion is efficiently creating value for the business, whether it’s through qualitative insights or prescriptive analytics. In my own free time, I love to learn about the newest ways technology and the realm of data and analytics are solving the most complex cases in our current world. As the world’s data becomes more complex, business problems do as well. To keep up with the fast pace of data and analytics, I partake in personal projects that cover recent developments in machine learning algorithms and generative AI. Some recent projects include predicting housing prices utilizing various machine learning algorithms including neural networks and stacking as well as generative AI projects that utilize large language models to classify and summarize text as well as identifying polarity and keywords.
      <br><br>
      My most prominent skills are with SQL, Python, NLP, hypothesis testing, and data exploration, visualization, and storytelling.
