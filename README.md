Hi, my name is Harry! I'm currently a data engineer, exploring the boundless potential of big data and analytics.

My work primarily consists of building the analytical layer of the People Team's data platform, creating tables and views via SQL that are front-facing to any project that my team creates. I also assist in Tableau development and assessing and investgating potential advanced analytics projects as we expand our technical capabilities from data analytics to data science.

I started my career journey as a Compensation Analyst in 2018 in Michigan, introducing analytics via excel, Tableau, and basic python, before moving to Seattle to pursue a larger career in Tech with Expedia Group in 2021. Within my short tenure at the company, I have taken on 2 promotions and have presented insights to various chief officers that directly report to the CEO. I have also expanded my technical library of skills to being the SQL expert of my team and studying advanced python libraries and packages such as pytorch, tensorflow, cv2, and streamlit.

I strive to continue to grow into a data scientist as it is my dream job, delivering advanced and meaningful insights to those that have the power to make change for good.
